# Graphical representation of data

We found that information given in a frequency distribution is easier to
interpret than raw data. Information given in a frequency distribution
in a tabular form is easier to grasp if presented graphically. Many
types of diagrams are used in statistics, depending on the nature of the
data and the purpose for which the diagram is intended.

**[Histogram]{.ul}**

A histogram consists of rectangles with:

-   Bases on a horizontal axis, centres at the class marks, and lengths
    equal to the class widths,

-   Areas proportional to class frequencies.

Note: If the class intervals are of equal size, then the heights of the
rectangles are proportional to the class frequencies and it is then
customary to take the heights of the rectangles numerically equal to the
class frequencies. If the class intervals are of different widths, then
the heights of the rectangles are proportional
to$\frac{\text{Class\ Frequency}}{\text{Class\ Width}}$. This ratio is
called frequency density.

Table below shows the frequency distribution of the body masses of 50
AIDS patients. Draw a Histogram.

  Mass        30 -- 39   40 -- 49   50 -- 59   60 -- 69   70 -- 79   80 -- 89
  ----------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
  Frequency   3          6          17         13         8          3

**Cumulative frequency curve** **(Ogive)**

A graph obtained by plotting a cumulative frequency against the class
boundary and joining the points by a smooth curve, is called a
cumulative frequency curve. It is also called as Ogive. Two types of
ogive are there, Less Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Less than
Ogive) and Greater Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Greater than
Ogive).

**Less Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Less than Ogive):** Here we
use the upper limit of the classes and the less than cumulative
frequency to plot the curve. Let us see for the example of the body
masses of 50 AIDS patients.

  Upper limit                      39   49   59   69   79   89
  -------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
  Less than Cumulative frequency   3    9    26   39   47   50

**Greater Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Greater than Ogive)**.
Here we use the lower limit of the classes and the Greater than
cumulative frequency to plot the curve.

  Lower Limit                         30   40   50   60   70   80
  ----------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
  Greater than Cumulative frequency   50   47   41   24   11   3

height="1.9652176290463692in"}

Intersection of both ogives gives the median

**Frequency polygon**

A grouped frequency table can also be represented by a frequency
polygon, which is a special kind of line graph. To construct a frequency
polygon, we plot a graph of class frequencies against the corresponding
class mid-points and join successive points with straight lines.

  Class Midpoints   34.5   44.5   54.5   64.5   74.5   84.5
  ----------------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
  Frequencies       3      6      17     13     8      3

height="2.591304680664917in"}

Frequency polygon is also obtained by joining the midpoints of a
histogram as shown below

**Stem-and-leaf plot**

A stem-and-leaf plot is a graphical device that is useful for
representing a relatively small set of data which takes numerical
values. To construct a stem-and-leaf plot, we partition each measurement
into two parts. The first part is called the stem, and the second part
is called the leaf. Here each numerical value is divided into two parts:
The leading digits become the stem the trailing digits become the leaf.
One advantage of the stem-and-leaf display over a frequency distribution
is that we retain the value of each observation. Another is the
distribution of the data within each groups is clear.

A stem-and-leaf plot conveys similar information as a histogram. Turned
on its side, it has the same shape as the histogram. In fact, since the
stem-and-leaf plot shows each observation,

it displays information that is lost in a histogram. A properly
constructed stem-and-leaf plot, like a histogram, provides information
regarding the range of the data set, shows the location of the highest
concentration of measurements, and reveals the presence or absence of
symmetry.

Consider the example

10,15,22,25,28,23,29,31,36,45,48

Stem and leaf plot will look like

  1   0 5
  --- -----------
  2   2 3 5 8 9
  3   1 6
  4   5 8

**Bar chart**

A bar chart is a diagram consisting of a series of horizontal or
vertical bars of equal width. The bars represent various categories of
the data. There are three types of bar charts, and these are simple bar
charts, component bar charts and grouped bar charts.

**(i) Simple bar chart**

In a simple bar chart, the height (or length) of each bar is equal to
the frequency it represents. For example data below shows the production
of timber in five districts of kerala in a certain year.

  Alappuzha   600
  ----------- ------
  Kannur      900
  Trissur     1800
  Ernakulam   1500
  Wayanad     2400

![meta-chart (1).png](media\image13.png){width="2.46956583552056in"
height="1.5576913823272092in"}

**Component bar chart**

In a component bar chart, the bar for each category is subdivided into
component parts; hence its name. Component bar charts are therefore used
to show the division of items into components. This is illustrated in
the following example.

Example shows the distribution of sales of agricultural produce from a
Farm in 1995, 1996 and 1997.

![Capture.JPG](media\image14.jpeg){width="2.9965583989501314in"

![hgh.JPG](media\image15.jpeg){width="3.74170384951881in"
height="2.1043482064741905in"}

The component bar chart shows the changes of each component over the
years as well as the comparison of the total sales between different
years.

**Grouped bar chart**

For a grouped bar chart, the components are grouped together and drawn
side by side. We illustrate this with the above example.

height="2.3913035870516186in"}

**Pie Charts**

A pie chart is a circular graph divided into sectors, each sector
representing a different value or category. The angle of each sector of
a pie chart is proportional to the value of the part of the data it
represents. The bar chart is more precise than the pie chart for visual
comparison of categories with similar relative frequencies.

[Steps for constructing a pie chart]{.ul}

\(1\) Find the sum of the category values.

\(2\) Calculate the angle of the sector for each category, using the
following formula

Angle of the sector for category A =
$\frac{\text{value\ of\ category\ A}}{\text{sum\ of\ category\ values}} \times 360$

\(3\) Construct a circle and mark the centre.

\(4\) Use a protractor to divide the circle into sectors, using the
angles obtained in step 2.

\(5\) Label each sector clearly.

See the example:

A housewife spent the following sums of money on buying ingredients for
a family Christmas cake.

  Ingredients     Price     Angle
  --------------- --------- ------------------
  Flour           24        (24/240)Ã—360= 36
  Margarine       96        144
  Sugar           18        27
  Eggs            60        90
  Baking powder   12        18
  Miscellaneous   30        45
  **Total**       **240**   **360**
