# Graphical representation of data

We found that information given in a frequency distribution is easier to interpret than raw data. Information given in a frequency distribution in a tabular form is easier to grasp if presented graphically. Many types of diagrams are used in statistics, depending on the nature of the data and the purpose for which the diagram is intended.

## Histogram

A histogram consists of rectangles with:

-   Bases on a horizontal axis, centres at the class marks, and lengths equal to the class widths.  

-   Areas proportional to class frequencies.

[Note:]{.ul}  
If the class intervals are of equal size, then the heights of the rectangles are proportional to the class frequencies and it is then customary to take the heights of the rectangles numerically equal to the class frequencies. If the class intervals are of different widths, then
the heights of the rectangles are proportional to $\frac{\text{Class Frequency}}{\text{Class Width}}$. This ratio is called **frequency density**.

Table below shows the frequency distribution of the body masses of 50 AIDS patients. Draw a Histogram.

  Mass        30 -- 39   40 -- 49   50 -- 59   60 -- 69   70 -- 79   80 -- 89
  ----------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
  Frequency   3          6          17         13         8          3

```{r hist1, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Histogram',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image8.png"))
```  


## Cumulative frequency curve (Ogive)

A graph obtained by plotting a cumulative frequency against the class boundary and joining the points by a smooth curve, is called a cumulative frequency curve. It is also called as Ogive. Two types of ogive are there, Less Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Less than Ogive) and Greater Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Greater than Ogive).

### Less than Ogive  
Also known as  less than type cumulative frequency curve. Here we use the upper limit of the classes and the less than cumulative frequency to plot the curve. Let us see for the example of the body masses of 50 AIDS patients.

  Upper limit                      39   49   59   69   79   89
  -------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
  Less than Cumulative frequency   3    9    26   39   47   50

```{r lto, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Less than ogive',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image9.jpeg"))
``` 

### Greater than Ogive
Also known as greater than type cumulative frequency curve Here we use the lower limit of the classes and the greater than cumulative frequency to plot the curve.

  Lower Limit                         30   40   50   60   70   80
  ----------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
  Greater than Cumulative frequency   50   47   41   24   11   3

```{r gco, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='greater than ogive',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image10.jpeg"))
```   
[Note:]{.ul}  
Intersection of both ogives gives the median

### Frequency polygon

A grouped frequency table can also be represented by a frequency
polygon, which is a special kind of line graph. To construct a frequency
polygon, we plot a graph of class frequencies against the corresponding
class mid-points and join successive points with straight lines.

  Class Midpoints   34.5   44.5   54.5   64.5   74.5   84.5
  ----------------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
  Frequencies       3      6      17     13     8      3

```{r freqpol, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Frequency polygon',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image11.jpeg"))
```

Frequency polygon is also obtained by joining the midpoints of a histogram as shown below

```{r frehit, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Frequency polygon and histogram',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image12.png"))
```

## Stem-and-leaf plot

A stem-and-leaf plot is a graphical device that is useful for representing a relatively small set of data which takes numerical values. To construct a stem-and-leaf plot, we partition each measurement into two parts. The first part is called the stem, and the second part is called the leaf. Here each numerical value is divided into two parts:
The leading digits become the stem the trailing digits become the leaf. One advantage of the stem-and-leaf display over a frequency distribution is that we retain the value of each observation. Another is the distribution of the data within each groups is clear. A stem-and-leaf plot conveys similar information as a histogram. Turned on its side, it has the same shape as the histogram. In fact, since the
stem-and-leaf plot shows each observation,it displays information that is lost in a histogram. A properly
constructed stem-and-leaf plot, like a histogram, provides information regarding the range of the data set, shows the location of the highest concentration of measurements, and reveals the presence or absence of symmetry.

Consider the example

10,15,22,25,28,23,29,31,36,45,48  

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt<-read.csv("csv/stem.csv")
dt %>%
  kbl(caption = "Stem and leaf plot") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

```  
```{r stem, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Stem and Leaf plot',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image18.png"))
```

## Bar chart  
A bar chart or bar graph is a diagram consisting of a series of horizontal or vertical bars of equal width. The bars represent various categories of the data. There are three types of bar charts, and these are simple bar charts, component bar charts and grouped bar charts.

### Simple bar chart  
In a simple bar chart, the height (or length) of each bar is equal to the value of category in the y-axis it represents. For example data below shows the production of timber in five districts of Kerala in a certain year.

  District    Production
  ----------- -----------
  Alappuzha   600
  Kannur      900
  Trissur     1800
  Ernakulam   1500
  Wayanad     2400

```{r bar, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Barchart',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image13.png"))
```

### Component bar chart

In a component bar chart, the bar for each category is subdivided into component parts; hence its name. Component bar charts are therefore used to show the division of items into components. This is illustrated in the following example.  

Example shows the distribution of sales of agricultural produce from a Farm in 1995, 1996 and 1997.  

```{r componentdata, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Sales data of agricultural produce',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image14.jpeg"))
```

```{r componentbar, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Component bar chart',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image15.jpeg"))
```  
The component bar chart shows the changes of each component over the years as well as the comparison of the total sales between different years.

### Grouped bar chart

For a grouped bar chart, the components are grouped together and drawn side by side. We illustrate this with the above example.  

```{r groupbar, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Grouped bar chart',fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image16.jpeg"))
```

## Pie Charts

A pie chart is a circular graph divided into sectors, each sector representing a different value or category. The angle of each sector of a pie chart is proportional to the value of the part of the data it represents. The bar chart is more precise than the pie chart for visual comparison of categories with similar relative frequencies.  

### Steps for constructing a pie chart

1. Find the sum of the category values.  
2. Calculate the angle of the sector for each category, using the following formula.Angle of the sector for category A = $\frac{\text{value of category A}}{\text{sum of category values}} \times 360$  
3. Construct a circle and mark the centre.  
4. Use a protractor to divide the circle into sectors, using the angles obtained in step 2.  
5. Label each sector clearly.

See the example:  
A housewife spent the following sums of money on buying ingredients for a family Christmas cake.

  Ingredients     Price     Angle
  --------------- --------- ------------------
  Flour           24        (24/240)×360= 36
  Margarine       96        144
  Sugar           18        27
  Eggs            60        90
  Baking powder   12        18
  Miscellaneous   30        45
  **Total**       **240**   **360**
