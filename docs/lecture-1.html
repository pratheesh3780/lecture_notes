<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Definition of Statistics</h2>
<p>Statistics is the science which deals with the</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Collection of data</p></li>
<li><p>Organization of data or Classification of data</p></li>
<li><p>Presentation of data</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of data</p></li>
<li><p>Interpretation of data</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Two main branches of statistics are:</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong>, which deals with summarize data from a
sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation etc.</p>
<p><strong>Inferential statistics</strong>, use a random sample of data taken from a
population to describe and make inferences about the population.</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong> are individual pieces of factual information recorded and used
for the purpose of analysis. It is the raw information from which
inferences are drawn using the science ‚ÄúSTATISTICS.‚Äù</p>
<p>Example for data</p>
<p>1. No.¬†of farmers in a block.</p>
<p>2. The rainfall over a period of time.</p>
<p>3. Area under paddy crop in a state.</p>
<p><strong>Functions of statistics</strong>: Statistics simplifies complexity, presents
facts in a definite form, helps in formulation of suitable policies,
facilitates comparison and helps in forecasting. valid results and
conclusion are obtained in research experiments using proper statistical
tools.</p>
<p><strong>Uses of statistics:</strong> Statistics has pervaded almost all spheres of
human activities. Statistics is useful in the administration of various
states, Industry, business, economics, research workers, banking,
insurance companies etc</p>
<p><u>Limitations of Statistics</u></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Statistical theories can be applied only when there is variability
in the experimental material.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistics deals with only aggregates or groups and not with
individual objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistical results are not exact.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistics can be misused.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Population and Sample</u></strong></p>
<p>Consider the following example.</p>
<p>Suppose we wish to study the body masses of all students of College of
Agriculture, Vellayani. It will take us a long time to measure the body
masses of all students of the college and so we may select 20 of the
students and measure their body masses (in kg). Suppose we obtain the
measurements like this</p>
<p>49 56 48 61 59 43 58 52 64 71 57 52 63 58 51 47 57 46 53 59</p>
<p>In this study, we are interested in the body masses of all students of
College of Agriculture, Vellayani. The set of body masses of all
students of College of Agriculture, Vellayani is called the
<strong>population</strong> of this study. The set of 20 body masses, <em>W</em> = {49, 56,
48, ‚Ä¶, 53, 59}, is a <strong>sample</strong> from this population.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 1</strong>: A population is the set of all objects we wish to
study</p>
<p><strong>Definition 2</strong>: A sample is part of the population we study to learn
about the population.</p>
<p><strong><u>Variables and constants</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Variables</strong></p>
<p>Any type of observation which can take different values for different
people, or different values at different times, or places, is called a
variable. The following are examples of variables:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>family size, number of hospital beds, number of schools in a
country, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>height, mass, blood pressure, temperature, blood glucose level, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are, broadly speaking, two types of variables ‚Äì quantitative and
qualitative (or categorical) variables</p>
<p><strong><u>Constants</u></strong></p>
<p>Constants are characteristics that have values that do not change.</p>
<p>Examples of constants are: pi (œÄ) = the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter (ùùÖ = 3.14159...) and <em>e</em>, the base of the
natural or (Napierian) logarithms (<em>e</em>=2.71828).</p>
<p><strong><u>Types of variables</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Quantitative variables</strong></p>
<p>A quantitative variable is one that can take numerical values. The
variables in (a) and (b), above, are examples of quantitative variables.
Quantitative variables may be characterized further as to whether they
are discrete or continuous</p>
<p><strong>Discrete variables</strong></p>
<p>The variables in (a), above, can be counted. These are examples of
discrete variables. Variables that can only take on a finite number of
values are called "discrete variables." Any variable phrased as ‚Äúthe
number of ‚Ä¶,‚Äù is discrete, because it is possible to list its possible
values {0,1, ‚Ä¶}. Any variable with a finite number of possible values
is discrete. The following example illustrates the point. The number of
daily admissions to a hospital is a discrete variable since it can be
represented by a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 or 3. The number of daily
admissions on a given day cannot be a number such as 1.8, 3.96 or 5.33.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous variables</strong></p>
<p>The variables in (b), above, can be measured. These are examples of
continuous variables. A continuous variable does not possess the gaps or
interruptions characteristic of a discrete variable. A continuous
variable can assume any value within a specific relevant interval of
values assumed by the variable. Notice that age is continuous since an
individual does not age in discrete jumps. Weight can be measured as
35.5, 35.8 kg etc so, it is a continuous variable.</p>
<p><strong>Categorical variables</strong></p>
<p>A variable is called categorical when the measurement scale is a set of
categories. For example, marital status, with categories (single,
married, widowed), is categorical. Whether employed (yes, no), religious
affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, others, none),
colours etc. Categorical variables are often called qualitative. It can
be seen that categorical variables can neither be measured nor counted.</p>
<p><strong><u>Levels of measurement and measurement scales</u></strong></p>
<p>Variables can further be classified according to the following four
levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Nominal scale:</strong> This scale of measure applies to qualitative
variables only. On the nominal scale, no order is required. For example,
gender is nominal, blood group is nominal, and marital status is also
nominal. We cannot perform arithmetic operations on data measured on the
nominal scale.</p>
<p><strong>Ordinal scale:</strong> This scale also applies to qualitative data. On the
ordinal scale, order is necessary. This means that one category is lower
than the next one or vice versa. For example, Grades are ordinal, as
excellent is higher than very good, which in turn is higher than good,
and so on. It should be noted that, in the ordinal scale, differences
between category values have no meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Interval scale:</strong> This scale of measurement applies to quantitative
data only. In this scale, the zero point does not indicate a total
absence of the quantity being measured. An example of such a scale is
temperature on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scale. Suppose the minimum
temperatures of 3 cities, A, B and C, on a particular day were 0<sup>0</sup>C,
20<sup>0</sup>C and 10<sup>0</sup>C, respectively. It is clear that we can find the
differences between these temperatures. For example, city B is 20<sup>0</sup>C
hotter than city A. However, we cannot say that city A has no
temperature. Moreover, we cannot say that city B is twice as hot as city
C, just because city B is 20<sup>0</sup>C and city C is 10<sup>0</sup>C. The reason is
that, in the interval scale, the ratio between two numbers is not
meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Ratio scale:</strong> This scale of measurement also applies to quantitative
data only and has all the properties of the interval scale. In addition
to these properties, the ratio scale has a meaningful zero starting
point and a meaningful ratio between 2 numbers. An example of variables
measured on the ratio scale, is weight. A weighing scale that reads 0 kg
gives an indication that there is absolutely no weight on it. So the
zero starting point is meaningful. If Ram weighs 40 kg and Laxman weighs
20 kg, then Ram weighs twice as Laxman. Another example of a variable
measured on the ratio scale is temperature measured on the Kelvin scale.
This has a true zero point.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><u>Collection of Data</u></strong></p>
<p>The first step in any enquiry (investigation) is the collection of data.
The data may be collected for the whole population or for a sample only.
It is mostly collected on a sample basis. Collecting data is very
difficult job. The enumerator or investigator is the well trained
individual who collects the statistical data. The respondents are the
persons from whom the information is collected.</p>
<p><u>Types of Data</u></p>
<p>There are two types (sources) for the collection of data:</p>
<p>(1) Primary Data (2) Secondary Data</p>
<p><strong>Primary Data</strong></p>
<p>Primary data are the first hand information which is collected, compiled
and published by organizations for some purpose. They are the most
original data in character and have not undergone any sort of
statistical treatment.</p>
<p>Example: Population census reports are primary data because these are
collected, complied and published by the population census organization.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Data</strong></p>
<p>The secondary data are the second hand information which is already
collected by an organization for some purpose and are available for the
present study. Secondary data are not pure in character and have
undergone some treatment at least once.</p>
<p>Example: An economic survey of England is secondary data because the
data are collected by more than one organization like the Bureau of
Statistics, Board of Revenue, banks, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of Collecting Primary Data</strong></p>
<p>Primary data are collected using the following methods:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Investigation</strong>: The researcher conducts the survey
him/herself and collects data from it. The data collected in this way
are usually accurate and reliable. This method of collecting data is
only applicable in case of small research projects.</p>
<p><strong>Through Investigation</strong>: Trained investigators are employed to collect
the data. These investigators contact the individuals and fill in
questionnaires after asking for the required information. Most
organizations utilize this method.</p>
<p><strong>Collection through Questionnaire</strong>: Researchers get the data from
local representations or agents that are based upon their own
experience. This method is quick but gives only a rough estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Through the Telephone</strong>: Researchers get information from individuals
through the telephone. This method is quick and gives accurate
information.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of Collecting Secondary Data</strong></p>
<p>Secondary data are collected by the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Official: e.g.¬†publications from the Statistical Division, Ministry
of Finance, the Federal Bureaus of Statistics, Ministries of Food,
Agriculture, Industry, Labor, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Semi-Official: e.g.¬†State Bank, Railway Board, Central Cotton
Committee, Boards of Economic Enquiry, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Publication of Trade Associations, Chambers of Commerce, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical and Trade Journals and Newspapers.</p></li>
<li><p>Research Organizations such as universities and other institutions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Difference Between Primary and Secondary Data</u></p>
<p>The difference between primary and secondary data is only a change of
hand. Primary data are the first hand information which is directly
collected form one source. They are the most original in character and
have not undergone any sort of statistical treatment, while secondary
data are obtained from other sources or agencies. They are not pure in
character and have undergone some treatment at least once.</p>
<p><strong><u>Frequency distribution</u></strong></p>
<p>Table shows the number of children per family for 54 families selected
from a town in India. The data, presented in this form in which it was
collected, is called raw data.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="media\image3.jpeg" style="width:5.54167in;height:0.79167in" alt="" />
<p class="caption">hhgvhg.JPG</p>
</div>
<p>It can be seen that, the minimum and the maximum numbers of children per
family are 0 and 4, respectively. Apart from these numbers, it is
impossible, without further careful study, to extract any exact
information from the data. But by breaking down the data into the form
below</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="media\image4.jpeg" style="width:4.95in;height:1.76667in" alt="" />
<p class="caption">asda.JPG</p>
</div>
<p>Now certain features of the data become apparent. For instance, it can
easily be seen that, most of the 54 families selected have two children
because number of houses having 2 children is 18. This information
cannot easily be obtained from the raw data.</p>
<p>The above table is called a frequency table or a frequency distribution.
It is so called because it gives the frequency or number of times each
observation occurs. Thus, by finding the frequency of each observation,
a more intelligible picture is obtained.</p>
<p>The steps for constructing a frequency distribution may be summarized as
follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>List all values of the variable in ascending order of magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>Form a tally column, that is, for each value in the data, record a
stroke in the tally column next to that value. In the tally, each
fifth stroke is made across the first four. This makes it easy to
count the entries and enter the frequency of each observation.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that the frequencies sum to the total number of observations</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Grouped frequency distribution</u></strong></p>
<p>Data below gives the body masses of 22 patients, measured to the nearest
kilogram.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="media\image5.jpeg" style="width:4.55in;height:0.54167in" alt="" />
<p class="caption">sdf.JPG</p>
</div>
<p>It can be seen that the minimum and the maximum body masses are 42 kg
and 83 kg, respectively. A frequency distribution giving every body mass
between 42 kg and 83 kg would be very long and would not be very
informative. The problem is to overcome by grouping the data into
classes. If we choose the classes 41 ‚Äì 49, 50 ‚Äì 58, 59 ‚Äì 67, 68 ‚Äì 76
and 77 ‚Äì 85, we obtain the frequency distribution given below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="media\image6.jpeg" style="width:4.93333in;height:1.70833in" alt="" />
<p class="caption">adsd.JPG</p>
</div>
<p>Above table gives the frequency of each group or class; it is therefore
called a grouped frequency table or a grouped frequency distribution.
Using this grouped frequency distribution, it is easier to obtain
information about the data than using the raw data. For instance, it can
be seen that 17 of the 22 patients have body masses between 50 kg and 76
kg (both inclusive). This information cannot easily be obtained from the
raw data.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, even though above table is concise, some
information is lost. For example, the grouped frequency distribution
does not give us the exact body masses of the patients. Thus the
individual body masses of the patients are lost in our effort to obtain
an overall picture.</p>
<p>We now define the terms that are used in grouped frequency tables.</p>
<p><strong>(i) Class limits</strong></p>
<p>The intervals into which the observations are put are called <u>class
intervals</u>. The end points of the class intervals are called <u>class
limits</u>. For example, the class interval 41 ‚Äì 49, has lower class
limit 41 and upper class limit 49.</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Class boundaries</strong></p>
<p>The raw data in the above example were recorded to the nearest kilogram.
Thus, a body mass of 49.5kg would have been recorded as 50 kg, a body
mass of 58.4 kg would have been recorded as 58 kg, while a body mass of
58.5 kg would have been recorded as 59 kg. It can therefore be seen
that, the class interval 50 ‚Äì 58, consists of measurements greater than
or equal to 49.5 kg and less than 58.5 kg. The numbers 49.5 and 58.5 are
called the lower and upper boundaries of the class interval 50 ‚Äì 58.
The class boundaries of the other class intervals are given below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="media\image7.jpeg" style="width:4.95833in;height:1.51667in" alt="" />
<p class="caption">dfgds.JPG</p>
</div>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Notice that the lower class boundary of the i<sup>th</sup> class interval is the
mean of the lower class limit of the class interval and the upper class
limit of the (i-1)<sup>th</sup> class interval (i = 2, 3, 4, ‚Ä¶). For example,
in the table above the lower class boundaries of the second and the
fourth class intervals are (50 + 49) /2 = 49.5 and (68 + 67)/2 = 67.5,
respectively.</p>
<p>It can also be seen that the upper class boundary of the i<sup>th</sup> class
interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and
the lower class limit of the (i+1)<sup>th</sup> class interval (i = 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶
). Thus, in the above table the upper class boundary of the fourth class
interval is (76 + 77)/2 = 76.5.</p>
<p><strong>(iii) Class mark</strong></p>
<p>The mid-point of a class interval is called the class mark or class
mid-point of the class interval. It is the average of the upper and
lower class limits of the class interval. It is also the average of the
upper and lower class boundaries of the class interval. For example, in
the table, the class mark of the third class interval was found as
follows: class mark =(59+67) /2 = (58.5 + 67.5)/2= 63.</p>
<p><strong>(iv) Class width</strong></p>
<p>The difference between the upper and lower class boundaries of a class
interval is called the class width of the class interval. Class widths
of class intervals can also be found by subtracting two consecutive
lower class limits, or by subtracting two consecutive upper class
limits.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>The width of the i<sup>th</sup> class interval is the numerical difference
between the upper class limits of the i<sup>th</sup> and the ( i-1)<sup>th</sup> class
intervals (i = 2, 3, ‚Ä¶). It is also the numerical difference between
the lower class limits of the i<sup>th</sup> and the (i+1) <sup>th</sup> class intervals
(i = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>In grouped frequency table above the width of the first class interval
is |41-50| = 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower
class limits of the first and the second class intervals. The width of
the second class interval is |50-59|= 9. This is the numerical
difference between the lower class limits of the second and the third
class intervals. It is also equal to |58-49| the numerical, difference
between the upper class limits of the first and the second class
intervals.</p>

<p>Consider the example</p>
<p>An agricultural student measured the lengths of leaves on an oak tree
(to the nearest cm). Measurements on 38 leaves are as follows</p>
<p>9,16,13,7,8,4,18,10,17,18,9,12,5,9,9,16,1,8,17,1,10,5,9,11,15,6,14,9,1,12,5,16,4,16,8,15,14,17</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Decide how many classes you wish to use.</p>
<p>H.A. Sturges provides a formula for determining the approximation number
of classes. <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{k = 1 + 3.322}\mathbf{\log}\mathbf{N}\)</span><strong>.</strong> Number
of classes should be greater than calculated <em>k</em></p>
<p>In our example <em>N</em>=38, so <em>k</em>=1+3.322√ólog(38) = 1+3.322√ó1.5797 = 6.24 =
approx 7</p>
<p>So the approximated number of classes should be not less than 6.24
<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>.<span class="math inline">\(\ k^{&#39;}\)</span> =7</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Determine the class width</p>
<p>Generally, the class width should be the same size for all classes. <em>C</em>
= | max ‚àí min|/ k</p>
<p>Class width <span class="math inline">\(C^{&#39;}\)</span>should be greater than calculated <em>C</em></p>
<p>For this example, <em>C</em> = | 18‚àí 1|/<strong>6.24</strong> = 2.72, so approximately
class width<span class="math inline">\(C^{&#39;} =\)</span> 3 (Note that <em>k</em> used here is the calculated value
using Struges formula not the approximated)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set up the individual class limits</p>
<p>We need to find the lower limit only</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L = min - \frac{C^{&#39;} \times k^{&#39;} - (max - min)}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>where C and <em>k</em> here are final approximated class width and number of
classes respectively</p>
<p>in our example <span class="math inline">\(L = 1 - \frac{3 \times 7 - (18 - 1)}{2}\)</span>=1-2=-1; since
there is no negative values in data = 0</p>

<p>Even though the student only measured in whole numbers, the data is
continuous, so "4 cm" means the actual value could have been anywhere
from 3.5 cm to 4.5 cm.</p>
<p><strong>Cumulative frequency</strong></p>
<p>In many situations, we are not interested in the number of observations
in a given class interval, but in the number of observations which are
less than (or greater than) a specified value. For example, in the above
table, it can be seen that 3 leaves have length less than 3.5 cm and 9
leaves (i.e.¬†3 + 6) have length less than 6.5 cm. These frequencies are
called cumulative frequencies. A table of such cumulative frequencies is
called <strong>a cumulative frequency table</strong> or <strong>cumulative frequency
distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>Cumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies.
Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous
frequencies up to the current point. Notice that the last cumulative
frequency is equal to the sum of all the frequencies.</p>
<p>Two types of cumulative frequencies are Less than cumulative frequency
and Greater than cumulative frequency. Less than cumulative frequency
(LCF) is the number of values less than a specified value. Greater than
cumulative frequency (GCF) is the number of observations greater than a
specified value.</p>
<p>The specified value for LCF in the case of grouped frequency
distribution will be upper limits and for GCF will be the lower limits
of the classes. LCF‚Äôs are obtained by adding frequencies in the
successive classes and GCF are obtained by subtracting the successive
class frequencies from the total frequency</p>
<p><strong>Relative frequency</strong></p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to know the proportion, rather than the number,
of values falling within a particular class interval. We obtain this
information by dividing the frequency of the particular class interval
by the total number of observations. <strong>Relative frequency</strong> of a class
is the frequency of class / total observation. Relative frequencies all
add up to 1</p>

<p><u><strong>Graphical representation of data</strong></u></p>
<p>We found that information given in a frequency distribution is easier to
interpret than raw data. Information given in a frequency distribution
in a tabular form is easier to grasp if presented graphically. Many
types of diagrams are used in statistics, depending on the nature of the
data and the purpose for which the diagram is intended.</p>
<p><strong><u>Histogram</u></strong></p>
<p>A histogram consists of rectangles with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bases on a horizontal axis, centres at the class marks, and lengths
equal to the class widths,</p></li>
<li><p>Areas proportional to class frequencies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the class intervals are of equal size, then the heights of the
rectangles are proportional to the class frequencies and it is then
customary to take the heights of the rectangles numerically equal to the
class frequencies. If the class intervals are of different widths, then
the heights of the rectangles are proportional
to<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{Class\ Frequency}}{\text{Class\ Width}}\)</span>. This ratio is
called frequency density.</p>

AIDS patients. Draw a Histogram.</p>

<p>A graph obtained by plotting a cumulative frequency against the class
boundary and joining the points by a smooth curve, is called a
cumulative frequency curve. It is also called as Ogive. Two types of
ogive are there, Less Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Less than
Ogive) and Greater Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Greater than
Ogive).</p>
<p><strong>Less Than Type Cumulative Frequency Curve (Less than Ogive):</strong> Here we
use the upper limit of the classes and the less than cumulative
frequency to plot the curve. Let us see for the example of the body
masses of 50 AIDS patients.</p>

<p>A grouped frequency table can also be represented by a frequency

<p><strong>Stem-and-leaf plot</strong></p>
<p>A stem-and-leaf plot is a graphical device that is useful for
representing a relatively small set of data which takes numerical
values. To construct a stem-and-leaf plot, we partition each measurement
into two parts. The first part is called the stem, and the second part
is called the leaf. Here each numerical value is divided into two parts:
The leading digits become the stem the trailing digits become the leaf.
One advantage of the stem-and-leaf display over a frequency distribution
is that we retain the value of each observation. Another is the
distribution of the data within each groups is clear.</p>
<p>A stem-and-leaf plot conveys similar information as a histogram. Turned
on its side, it has the same shape as the histogram. In fact, since the
stem-and-leaf plot shows each observation,</p>
<p>it displays information that is lost in a histogram. A properly
constructed stem-and-leaf plot, like a histogram, provides information
regarding the range of the data set, shows the location of the highest
concentration of measurements, and reveals the presence or absence of
symmetry.</p>
<p>Consider the example</p>
<p>10,15,22,25,28,23,29,31,36,45,48</p>

<p><strong>Bar chart</strong></p>
<p>A bar chart is a diagram consisting of a series of horizontal or
vertical bars of equal width. The bars represent various categories of
the data. There are three types of bar charts, and these are simple bar
charts, component bar charts and grouped bar charts.</p>
<p><strong>(i) Simple bar chart</strong></p>
<p>In a simple bar chart, the height (or length) of each bar is equal to
the frequency it represents. For example data below shows the production
of timber in five districts of kerala in a certain year.</p>

<p><strong>Component bar chart</strong></p>
<p>In a component bar chart, the bar for each category is subdivided into
component parts; hence its name. Component bar charts are therefore used
to show the division of items into components. This is illustrated in
the following example.</p>
<p>Example shows the distribution of sales of agricultural produce from a
Farm in 1995, 1996 and 1997.</p>

<p class="caption">hgh.JPG</p>
</div>
<p>The component bar chart shows the changes of each component over the
years as well as the comparison of the total sales between different
years.</p>
<p><strong>Grouped bar chart</strong></p>
<p>For a grouped bar chart, the components are grouped together and drawn
side by side. We illustrate this with the above example.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p><strong>Pie Charts</strong></p>
<p>A pie chart is a circular graph divided into sectors, each sector
representing a different value or category. The angle of each sector of
a pie chart is proportional to the value of the part of the data it
represents. The bar chart is more precise than the pie chart for visual
comparison of categories with similar relative frequencies.</p>
<p><u>Steps for constructing a pie chart</u></p>
<p>(1) Find the sum of the category values.</p>
<p>(2) Calculate the angle of the sector for each category, using the
following formula</p>
<p>Angle of the sector for category A =
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{value\ of\ category\ A}}{\text{sum\ of\ category\ values}} \times 360\)</span></p>
<p>(3) Construct a circle and mark the centre.</p>
<p>(4) Use a protractor to divide the circle into sectors, using the
angles obtained in step 2.</p>
<p>(5) Label each sector clearly.</p>
<p>See the example:</p>
<p>A housewife spent the following sums of money on buying ingredients for
a family Christmas cake.</p>
