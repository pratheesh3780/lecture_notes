<div id="origin-of-the-word-statistics" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Origin of the word “Statistics”</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The term statistics was derived from the Neo-Latin word <code>statisticum collegium</code> meaning “council of state” and the Italian word <code>statista</code> meaning “statesman” or “politician.”
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A German word <code>Statistik</code>, got the meaning “collection and classification of data” generally in the early 19th century. This word was first introduced by Gottfried Achenwall (1749). <code>Statistik</code> was originally designated as a term for analysis of data about the state (data used by government or other administrative bodies). The term <code>Statistik</code> was introduced into English in 1791 by Sir John Sinclair when he published the first of 21 volumes titled “Statistical Account of Scotland” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ball" role="doc-biblioref">Ball 2004</a>)</span>. The first book to have ‘Statistics’ in its title was “Contributions to Vital Statistics” (1845) by Francis GP Neison, actuary<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Definition of Statistics</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Statistics is the science which deals with the</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collection of data</p></li>
<li><p>Organization of data or Classification of data</p></li>
<li><p>Presentation of data</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of data</p></li>
<li><p>Interpretation of data</p>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Two main branches of statistics are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Descriptive statistics</strong>, which deals with summarizing data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation etc.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Inferential statistics</strong>, use a random sample of data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the population parameters.
</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Data can be defined as individual pieces of factual information recorded and used for the purpose of analysis. It is the raw information from which inferences are drawn using the science “STATISTICS.”
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Example for data</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No. of farmers in a block.</p></li>
<li><p>The rainfall over a period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Area under paddy crop in a state.</p>

<div id="use-and-limitations-of-statistics" class="section level2" number="1.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Use and limitations of statistics</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Functions of statistics</strong>: Statistics simplifies complexity, presents facts in a definite form, helps in formulation of suitable policies, facilitates comparison and helps in forecasting. Valid results and conclusion are obtained in research experiments using proper statistical tools.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Uses of statistics:</strong> Statistics has pervaded almost all spheres of human activities. Statistics is useful in the administration, Industry, business, economics, research workers, banking,insurance companies etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of Statistics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Statistical theories can be applied only when there is variability in the experimental material.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistics deals with only aggregates or groups and not with individual objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistical results are not exact.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistics are often misused.</p></li>

<div id="population-and-sample" class="section level2" number="1.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Population and Sample</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following example.Suppose we wish to study the body masses of all students of College of Agriculture, Vellayani. It will take us a long time to measure the body masses of all students of the college and so we may select 20 of the students and measure their body masses (in kg). Suppose we obtain the measurements like this
</p>
<p>49 56 48 61 59 43 58 52 64 71 57 52 63 58 51 47 57 46 53 59</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this study, we are interested in the body masses of all students of College of Agriculture, Vellayani. The set of body masses of all students of College of Agriculture, Vellayani is called the <strong>population</strong> of this study. The set of 20 body masses, <em>W</em> = {49, 56,48, …, 53, 59}, is a <strong>sample</strong> from this population.
</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Variables and constants</h2>
<div id="variables" class="section level3" number="1.7.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.1</span> Variables</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Any type of observation which can take different values for different people, or different values at different times, or places, is called a variable. The following are examples of variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>family size, number of hospital beds, number of schools in a country, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>height, mass, blood pressure, temperature, blood glucose level, etc.</p>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Broadly speaking, there are two types of variables – <strong>quantitative</strong> and <strong>qualitative</strong> (or categorical) variables
</p>
</div>
<div id="constants" class="section level3" number="1.7.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.7.2</span> Constants</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Constants are characteristics that have values that do not change. Examples of constants are: pi (𝝅) = the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (𝝅 = 3.14159...) and <em>e</em>, the base of the natural or (Napierian) logarithms (<em>e</em>=2.71828).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="types-of-variables" class="section level2" number="1.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Types of variables</h2>
<div id="quantitative-variables" class="section level3" number="1.8.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.1</span> Quantitative variables</h3>
<p>A quantitative variable is one that can take numerical values. The variables like family size, number of hospital beds, number of schools in a country, height, mass, blood pressure, temperature, blood glucose level, etc. are examples of quantitative variables. Quantitative variables may be characterized further as to whether they
are discrete or continuous</p>
</div>
<div id="discrete-variables" class="section level3" number="1.8.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.2</span> Discrete variables</h3>
<p>The variables like family size, number of hospital beds, number of schools in a country, etc. can be counted. These are examples of discrete variables. Variables that can only take on a finite number of values are called "discrete variables." Any variable phrased as “the number of …,” is discrete, because it is possible to list its possible
values {0,1, …}. Any variable with a finite number of possible values is discrete. The following example illustrates the point. The number of daily admissions to a hospital is a discrete variable since it can be represented by a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 or 3. The number of daily
admissions on a given day cannot be a number such as 1.8, 3.96 or 5.33.</p>
</div>
<div id="continuous-variables" class="section level3" number="1.8.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.3</span> Continuous variables</h3>
<p>The variables like height, mass, blood pressure, temperature, blood glucose level, etc. can be measured. These are examples of continuous variables. A continuous variable does not possess the gaps or interruptions characteristic of a discrete variable. A continuous
variable can assume any value within a specific relevant interval of values assumed by the variable. Notice that age is continuous since an individual does not age in discrete jumps. Weight can be measured as 35.5, 35.8 kg etc so, it is a continuous variable.</p>
</div>
<div id="categorical-variables" class="section level3" number="1.8.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.8.4</span> Categorical variables</h3>
<p>A variable is called categorical when the measurement scale is a set of categories. For example, marital status, with categories (single,married, widowed), is categorical. Whether employed (yes, no), religious affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, others, none),
colours etc. Categorical variables are often called qualitative. It can be seen that categorical variables can neither be measured nor counted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="measurement-scales" class="section level2" number="1.9">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Measurement scales</h2>
<p>Variables can further be classified according to the following four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.</p>
<div id="nominal-scale" class="section level3" number="1.9.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.9.1</span> Nominal scale</h3>
<p>This scale of measure applies to qualitative variables only. On the nominal scale, no order is required. For example,gender is nominal, blood group is nominal, and marital status is also nominal. We cannot perform arithmetic operations on data measured on the nominal scale.</p>
</div>
<div id="ordinal-scale" class="section level3" number="1.9.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.9.2</span> Ordinal scale</h3>
<p>This scale also applies to qualitative data. On the
ordinal scale, order is necessary. This means that one category is lower than the next one or vice versa. For example, Grades are ordinal, as excellent is higher than very good, which in turn is higher than good, and so on. It should be noted that, in the ordinal scale, differences between category values have no meaning.</p>
</div>
<div id="interval-scale" class="section level3" number="1.9.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.9.3</span> Interval scale</h3>
<p>This scale of measurement applies to quantitative
data only. In this scale, the zero point does not indicate a total absence of the quantity being measured. An example of such a scale is temperature on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scale. Suppose the minimum temperatures of 3 cities, A, B and C, on a particular day were 0<sup>0</sup>C, 20<sup>0</sup>C and 10<sup>0</sup>C, respectively. It is clear that we can find the differences between these temperatures. For example, city B is 20<sup>0</sup>C hotter than city A. However, we cannot say that city A has no temperature. Moreover, we cannot say that city B is twice as hot as city C, just because city B is 20<sup>0</sup>C and city C is 10<sup>0</sup>C. The reason is that, in the interval scale, the ratio between two numbers is not meaningful.</p>
</div>
<div id="ratio-scale" class="section level3" number="1.9.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.9.4</span> Ratio scale</h3>
<p>This scale of measurement also applies to quantitative
data only and has all the properties of the interval scale. In addition to these properties, the ratio scale has a meaningful zero starting point and a meaningful ratio between 2 numbers. An example of variables measured on the ratio scale, is weight. A weighing scale that reads 0 kg
gives an indication that there is absolutely no weight on it. So the zero starting point is meaningful. If Ram weighs 40 kg and Laxman weighs 20 kg, then Ram weighs twice as Laxman. Another example of a variable measured on the ratio scale is temperature measured on the Kelvin scale. This has a true zero point.</p>

<p>The first step in any enquiry (investigation) is the collection of data. The data may be collected for the whole population or for a sample only. It is mostly collected on a sample basis. Collecting data is very difficult job. The enumerator or investigator is the well trained individual who collects the statistical data. The respondents are the persons from whom the information is collected.</p>
<div id="types-of-data" class="section level3" number="1.10.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.10.1</span> Types of Data</h3>
<p>There are two types (sources) for the collection of data:
* Primary Data<br />
* Secondary Data</p>
<div id="primary-data" class="section level4" number="1.10.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.10.1.1</span> Primary Data</h4>
<p>Primary data are the first hand information which is collected, compiled and published by organizations for some purpose. They are the most original data in character and have not undergone any sort of statistical treatment.</p>
<p>Example: Population census reports are primary data because these are collected, complied and published by the population census organization.</p>
</div>
<div id="secondary-data" class="section level4" number="1.10.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.10.1.2</span> Secondary Data</h4>
<p>The secondary data are the second hand information which is already collected by an organization for some purpose and are available for the present study. Secondary data are not pure in character and have undergone some treatment at least once.</p>
<p>Example: An economic survey of England is secondary data because the data are collected by more than one organization like the Bureau of Statistics, Board of Revenue, banks, etc.</p>

<div id="methods-of-collecting-primary-data" class="section level2" number="1.11">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.11</span> Methods of Collecting Primary Data</h2>
<p>Primary data are collected using the following methods:</p>
<div id="personal-investigation" class="section level3" number="1.11.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.11.1</span> Personal Investigation</h3>
<p>The researcher conducts the survey him/herself and collects data from it. The data collected in this way are usually accurate and reliable. This method of collecting data is
only applicable in case of small research projects.</p>
</div>
<div id="through-investigation" class="section level3" number="1.11.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.11.2</span> Through Investigation</h3>
<p>Trained investigators are employed to collect the data. These investigators contact the individuals and fill in
questionnaires after asking for the required information. Most organizations utilize this method.</p>
</div>
<div id="collection-through-questionnaire" class="section level3" number="1.11.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.11.3</span> Collection through Questionnaire</h3>
<p>Researchers get the data from local representations or agents that are based upon their own experience. This method is quick but gives only a rough estimate.</p>
</div>
<div id="through-the-telephone" class="section level3" number="1.11.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.11.4</span> Through the Telephone</h3>
<p>Researchers get information from individuals through the telephone. This method is quick and gives accurate information.</p>
</div>

<div id="methods-of-collecting-secondary-data" class="section level2" number="1.12">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.12</span> Methods of Collecting Secondary Data</h2>
<p>Secondary data are collected by the following methods:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.13</span> Difference Between Primary and Secondary Data</h2>
<p>The difference between primary and secondary data is only a change of hand. Primary data are the first hand information which is directly collected form one source. They are the most original in character and have not undergone any sort of statistical treatment, while secondary data are obtained from other sources or agencies. They are not pure in character and have undergone some treatment at least once.</p>

Table shows the number of children per family for 54 families selected from a town in India. The data, presented in this form in which it was collected, is called raw data.<br />

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.3: raw data set of No. of children in 54 families
</p>
</div>
It can be seen that, the minimum and the maximum numbers of children per family are 0 and 4, respectively. Apart from these numbers, it is impossible, without further careful study, to extract any exact information from the data. But by breaking down the data into the form below<br />

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:freq"></span>
<img src="images/image4.jpeg" alt="Frequency distribution table" width="297" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Now certain features of the data become apparent. For instance, it can easily be seen that, most of the 54 families selected have two children because number of houses having 2 children is 18. This information cannot easily be obtained from the raw data. The above table is called a frequency table or a frequency distribution. It is so called because it gives the frequency or number of times each
observation occurs. Thus, by finding the frequency of each observation, a more intelligible picture is obtained.</p>

<p>Data below gives the body masses of 22 patients, measured to the nearest kilogram.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.5: Body masses of 22 patients
</p>
</div>
<p>It can be seen that the minimum and the maximum body masses are 42 kg and 83 kg, respectively. A frequency distribution giving every body mass between 42 kg and 83 kg would be very long and would not be very informative. The problem is to overcome by grouping the data into classes.<br />
If we choose the classes<br />
41 – 49<br />
50 – 58<br />
59 – 67<br />
68 – 76
and 77 – 85, we obtain the frequency distribution given below:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:grptable"></span>
<img src="images/image6.jpeg" alt="Grouped Frequency distribution table" width="296" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.6: Grouped Frequency distribution table
</p>
</div>
<p>Above table gives the frequency of each group or class; it is therefore called a grouped frequency table or a grouped frequency distribution. Using this grouped frequency distribution, it is easier to obtain information about the data than using the raw data. For instance, it can be seen that 17 of the 22 patients have body masses between 50 kg and 76 kg (both inclusive). This information cannot easily be obtained from the raw data.<br />
It should be noted that, even though above table is concise, some information is lost. For example, the grouped frequency distribution does not give us the exact body masses of the patients. Thus the individual body masses of the patients are lost in our effort to obtain an overall picture.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms-used-in-grouped-frequency-tables." class="section level2" number="1.16">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.16</span> Terms used in grouped frequency tables.</h2>
<p><strong>Class limits</strong></p>
<p>The intervals into which the observations are put are called <u>class intervals</u>. The end points of the class intervals are called <u>class limits</u>. For example, the class interval 41 – 49, has lower class limit 41 and upper class limit 49.</p>
<p><strong>Class boundaries</strong></p>
<p>The raw data in the above example were recorded to the nearest kilogram. Thus, a body mass of 49.5kg would have been recorded as 50 kg, a body mass of 58.4 kg would have been recorded as 58 kg, while a body mass of 58.5 kg would have been recorded as 59 kg. It can therefore be seen
that, the class interval 50 – 58, consists of measurements greater than or equal to 49.5 kg and less than 58.5 kg. The numbers 49.5 and 58.5 are called the lower and upper boundaries of the class interval 50 – 58. The class boundaries of the other class intervals are given below:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:clsslmt"></span>
<img src="images/image7.jpeg" alt="Class boundary and class limits" width="298" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.7: Class boundary and class limits
</p>
</div>
<p><u>Note:</u><br />
Notice that the lower class boundary of the i<sup>th</sup> class interval is the mean of the lower class limit of the class interval and the upper class limit of the (i-1)<sup>th</sup> class interval (i = 2, 3, 4, …). For example, in the table above the lower class boundaries of the second and the fourth class intervals are (50 + 49) /2 = 49.5 and (68 + 67)/2 = 67.5 respectively.<br />
It can also be seen that the upper class boundary of the i<sup>th</sup> class interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and the lower class limit of the (i+1)<sup>th</sup> class interval (i = 1, 2, 3, …). Thus, in the above table the upper class boundary of the fourth class
interval is (76 + 77)/2 = 76.5.</p>
<p><strong>Class mark</strong><br />
The mid-point of a class interval is called the class mark or class mid-point of the class interval. It is the average of the upper and lower class limits of the class interval. It is also the average of the upper and lower class boundaries of the class interval. For example, in the table, the class mark of the third class interval was found as
follows: class mark =(59+67) /2 = (58.5 + 67.5)/2= 63.</p>
<p><strong>Class width</strong><br />
The difference between the upper and lower class boundaries of a class interval is called the class width of the class interval. Class widths of class intervals can also be found by subtracting two consecutive lower class limits, or by subtracting two consecutive upper class limits.</p>
<p><u>Note:</u></p>
<p>The width of the i<sup>th</sup> class interval is the numerical difference between the upper class limits of the i<sup>th</sup> and the ( i-1)<sup>th</sup> class intervals (i = 2, 3, …). It is also the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the i<sup>th</sup> and the (i+1) <sup>th</sup> class intervals (i = 1, 2, …).</p>
<p>In grouped frequency table above the width of the first class interval is |41-50| = 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the first and the second class intervals. The width of the second class interval is |50-59|= 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the second and the third
class intervals. It is also equal to |58-49| the numerical, difference between the upper class limits of the first and the second class intervals.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.17</span> Construction of frequency distribution table</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Decide how many classes you wish to use.<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>. Determine the class width<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>. Set up the individual class limits
<strong>Step 4</strong>. Tally the items into the classes<br />
<strong>Step 5</strong>. Count the number of items in each class</p>
<p>Consider the example<br />
An agricultural student measured the lengths of leaves on an oak tree (to the nearest cm). Measurements on 38 leaves are as follows<br />
9,16,13,7,8,4,18,10,17,18,9,12,5,9,9,16,1,8,17,1,10,5,9,11,15,6,14,9,1,12,5,16,4,16,8,15,14,17</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Decide how many classes you wish to use.</p>
<p>H.A. Sturges provides a formula for determining the approximation number
of classes. <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{k = 1 + 3.322}\mathbf{\log}\mathbf{N}\)</span><strong>.</strong> Number
of classes should be greater than calculated <em>k</em></p>
<p>In our example <em>N</em>=38, so <em>k</em>=1+3.322×log(38) = 1+3.322×1.5797 = 6.24 =
approx 7</p>
<p>So the approximated number of classes should be not less than 6.24
<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>.<span class="math inline">\(\ k^{&#39;}\)</span> =7</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Determine the class width</p>
<p>Generally, the class width should be the same size for all classes. <em>C</em>
= | max − min|/ k</p>
<p>Class width <span class="math inline">\(C^{&#39;}\)</span>should be greater than calculated <em>C</em></p>
<p>For this example, <em>C</em> = | 18− 1|/<strong>6.24</strong> = 2.72, so approximately
class width<span class="math inline">\(C^{&#39;} =\)</span> 3 (Note that <em>k</em> used here is the calculated value
using Struges formula not the approximated)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set up the individual class limits</p>
<p>We need to find the lower limit only</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L = min - \frac{C^{&#39;} \times k^{&#39;} - (max - min)}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>where C and <em>k</em> here are final approximated class width and number of
classes respectively</p>
<p>in our example <span class="math inline">\(L = 1 - \frac{3 \times 7 - (18 - 1)}{2}\)</span>=1-2=-1; since
there is no negative values in data = 0</p>

<div id="cumulative-frequency" class="section level2" number="1.18">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.18</span> Cumulative frequency</h2>
<p>In many situations, we are not interested in the number of observations
in a given class interval, but in the number of observations which are
less than (or greater than) a specified value. For example, in the above
table, it can be seen that 3 leaves have length less than 3.5 cm and 9
leaves (i.e. 3 + 6) have length less than 6.5 cm. These frequencies are
called cumulative frequencies. A table of such cumulative frequencies is
called <strong>a cumulative frequency table</strong> or <strong>cumulative frequency
distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>Cumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies.
Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous
frequencies up to the current point. Notice that the last cumulative
frequency is equal to the sum of all the frequencies.</p>
<p>Two types of cumulative frequencies are Less than cumulative frequency
and Greater than cumulative frequency. Less than cumulative frequency
(LCF) is the number of values less than a specified value. Greater than
cumulative frequency (GCF) is the number of observations greater than a
specified value.</p>
<p>The specified value for LCF in the case of grouped frequency
distribution will be upper limits and for GCF will be the lower limits
of the classes. LCF’s are obtained by adding frequencies in the
successive classes and GCF are obtained by subtracting the successive
class frequencies from the total frequency</p>
</div>
<div id="relative-frequency" class="section level2" number="1.19">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.19</span> Relative frequency</h2>
<p>It is sometimes useful to know the proportion, rather than the number,
of values falling within a particular class interval. We obtain this
information by dividing the frequency of the particular class interval
by the total number of observations. <strong>Relative frequency</strong> of a class
is the frequency of class / total observation. Relative frequencies all
add up to 1</p>
